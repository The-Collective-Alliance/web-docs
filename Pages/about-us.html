    <h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
    <h3>The Goal of the collective</h3>
         <p>Focusing on our community and a safe space to play the game.<br>
         The community makes or breaks your experience of a game. We are focusing on players over guilds.<br>
          The players are the part that matters in this, we want all of them to be strong in the place we are and not in the place we force them to be for the guild's strength.<br>
           We aim to have a home for every player.</p>
<br>
    <h3>The Community</h3>
          <p> An area where a group of mobile gamers feel safe to play a gamer they enjoy at the pace they want.<br>
          Living day-to-day life together through our community chats.<br>
          We aim to keep our community chat relevant, active, and engaging.</p>
<br>
    <h3>Our Movement</h3>
         <p>The goal of movement is to move a player up or down to a guild that they feel is home for them and that also matches the guild's participation requirement.<br>
         We aim to have everyone in a guild that their playstyle fits the guildâ€™s guidelines.<br> 
         Guild growth: In order to achieve this we must be open and looking to growing the alliance as our supply and demand needs.<br>
         We should always be able to have a spot for anyone somewhere in the alliance.</p>
<br>
    <h3>The Alliance</h3>
             <p>We aim to only have to send someone away from the alliance if we have to. We are a community first.<br>
             We will look out for and protect our members first.<br> We are not a feeder guild system.<br>
             People belong where they fit best.</p>
<br>
    <h3>Our Guilds</h3>
             <p>The guilds may operate as they choose as long as they agree with the guild guidelines set in place and their members are happy and healthy with the state of their guild.</p>
<br>
    <h3>The Recruitment:</h3>
             <p>The alliance will advertise the alliance as a whole or in addition to their own individual guild.<br>
             When recruits come through the drop zone they will go through our recruitment<br>
             process where they are offered every guild they qualify for and will choose the one they think best fits them.<br>
             Special cases of exclusion on this will include direct recruits that you have coming to your guild before they join the server,<br>
             also if there is a guild struggling for active members then alliance leadership may direct recruits to that guild to rescue it from its failing.</p>
<br>
    <h3>Decision making</h3>
     <p>Grand Moffs and Admirals decide day-to-day things about the alliance.<br>
     Large changes are presented to the GLs and voted upon by them if they will be implemented for the alliance.<br>
     The Grand Moffs are in charge of the Admiral positions.<br>
     The GLs can vote at any time to replace or remove an Grand Moff and vote for a new one.</p>
